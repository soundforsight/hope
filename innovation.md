# Our Innovation

## The Problem

Today, visually impaired individuals have to rely on guide dogs, canes, or other expensive, specialized devices for navigation. 


## How is it Solved Now?

Our application offers a more affordable and accessible alternative, promoting inclusivity and self reliance. 

## Our Solution and Innovation

Our product for the visually impaired: an app running on a phone that you can install allows visually impaired people to scan their surroundings and get an auditory explanation. People can be safer for cheaper with our product. Our model can predict accuracy with a loss of 0.2, which really helps keep visually impaired people safe. By recognizing hazards, we can make sure people stay safe, since we cannot afford to lose lives. 

## What Makes Our Solution Unique

Our innovation demonstrates a significant cost advantage, approximately 65.1% less expensive than the WeWALK smart cane. This affordability enhances accessibility and addresses the financial constraints faced by individuals with visual impairments. Furthermore, our device boasts an intuitive user interface, incomparable resolution, and an advanced Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). These features contribute to a more sophisticated and user-friendly experience compared to existing alternatives.

## Why our solution is key: expansion into common technologies

Looking ahead, we envision integrating our technology with other wearable devices, such as smart glasses. Meta has been releasing glasses with built in cameras, the latest version being called the Meta Wayfarers. These glasses have a built-in microprocessor and in ear audio, which when paired with the cameras, is an ideal platform to run our application on. The smart glasses would allow visually impaired persons to wear sunglasses and essentially “hear” everything around them.
