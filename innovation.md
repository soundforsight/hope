# Our Innovation

## The Problem
Individuals with disabilities, particularly the visually impaired, face numerous daily challenges. Navigating through environments, recognizing objects, and avoiding obstacles are tasks that most people take for granted but can be significant hurdles for those with visual impairments. Traditional aids like the white cane or guide dogs provide some assistance but are limited in their ability to offer comprehensive and intuitive feedback about the surrounding environment.


## How is it Solved Now?
Presently, the solutions for aiding visually impaired individuals mainly revolve around rudimentary tools like the white cane, or high-cost options like guide dogs. Some technological solutions exist, but they often are either too expensive, cumbersome, or fail to provide a holistic experience.


## Our Solution and Innovation
Our innovation, SoundForSight, is a cutting-edge application combined with a machine learning (ML) program designed to address these challenges effectively. SoundForSight is a wearable device that uses advanced cameras and sensors to capture visual information. This data is then processed through our proprietary ML algorithms, which interpret and translate the visual cues into auditory feedback delivered to the user in real-time. The device is designed to be lightweight, comfortable, and easy to use, making it a practical solution for everyday life.


## What Makes Our Solution Unique
The uniqueness of SoundForSight lies in its affordability and accessibility. Unlike other high-cost technologies, our solution is priced to be accessible to a broader range of individuals, ensuring that more people can benefit from this advanced technology. The cost-effectiveness, 65.1% more cost friendly than altenratives such as the biped, makes it a superior choice compared to current market offerings. Furthermore, our device's adaptability to various environments and situations makes it a versatile tool for the visually impaired.


## Why our solution is key: expansion into common technologies
A pivotal aspect of our innovation is its potential for integration with commonly used technologies, such as the Meta Glasses. By incorporating SoundForSight with such devices, we can offer users a more immersive and seamless experience. This integration would leverage existing platforms to enhance the functionality of our device, providing hands-free navigation, object recognition, and environmental awareness through a more familiar, everyday technology. This expansion not only makes our solution more accessible but also aligns it with the trajectory of tech advancements, ensuring its relevance to the visually impared communities' evolving needs.
